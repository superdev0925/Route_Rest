"""Hours-of-Service (HOS) planning engine.

Implements the federal property-carrying driver rules used by the
assessment (49 CFR Part 395), assuming a 70-hour / 8-day cycle and no
adverse driving conditions:

  * 11-hour driving limit per shift
  * 14-hour on-duty "driving window" per shift
  * 30-minute break required after 8 cumulative hours of driving
  * 70-hour / 8-day on-duty limit (with optional 34-hour restart)
  * 10 consecutive hours off duty to reset the daily limits

Trip assumptions baked in:
  * Average driving speed of 55 mph
  * 1 hour on duty (not driving) for pickup, 1 hour for drop-off
  * A fuel stop (~30 min on duty) at least every 1,000 miles

The engine walks a virtual clock forward, emitting a flat list of duty
segments. Each segment carries an absolute start/end time, a duty status,
and a human-readable label. The segments are later sliced into 24-hour
calendar days to draw the ELD log sheets.
